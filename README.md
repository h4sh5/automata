# cellular automata

This is a repo of me learning about Cellular Automaton, and writing stuff from scratch in python.

Currently, a harness for 1D and 2D CA is implemented, with some cool rules implemented (like Wolfram's rule 30 and rule 110)

Some links about CA (the wolfram ones are especially helpful for getting reduced algebraic formulas of rules):
